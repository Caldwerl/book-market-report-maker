book-market-report-maker
========================

Produce a formatted readable report to an output file report.txt that
lists all of the books and groups them by market. 

Only title, ISBN, author, quantity, price, and inventory value need be listed for each book. 

For each market, include the name of the market, the total number of inventory record 
(the same title may appear more than once) listed for that market, the total quantity of books for that market,
the total market value of all of the books for that market, the average book price for that market,
and the marketâ€™s name, company name, and address information from the markets.txt file.

At the very end of the report, provide the total number of inventory records for all
markets, the total quantity of books for all markets, the total market value of all of the
books for all markets, and the average book price for all markets.
